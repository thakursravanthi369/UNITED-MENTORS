Project Report: Online Gas Booking System

1. Introduction

1.1 Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an online gas booking system that enables customers to conveniently book gas cylinders and manage their accounts. The system eliminates the need for traditional phone bookings, streamlining the process for both customers and administrators.
1.2 Purpose and Objectives:
Purpose: To provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for gas cylinder booking.
Objectives:
Develop a secure user authentication system.
Implement an online booking functionality.
Create an administrative interface for managing bookings and notifications.
Integrate online payment options (Paytm QR, Cash on Delivery).
Implement email notifications for transactions.
Provide a booking history feature for users.
1.3 Scope:
The system includes user registration, login, cylinder booking, booking history, payment processing, and administrative functionalities for booking approval and notifications.
The project will utilize Firebase as the backend and standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
2. System Requirements

2.1 Functional Requirements:
User Registration: Users must be able to create accounts with email and password.
User Login: Users must be able to log in securely.
Cylinder Booking: Users must be able to book cylinders online.
Booking History: Users must be able to view their booking history.
Payment Processing: Users must be able to pay using Paytm QR or Cash on Delivery.
Admin Approval/Rejection: Administrators must be able to approve or reject booking requests.
Notifications: Administrators must be able to send notifications to users.
Email Notifications: The system must send email notifications for registrations, bookings, and approvals.
2.2 Non-Functional Requirements:
Security: The system must protect user data and payment information.
Usability: The system must be user-friendly and intuitive.
Performance: The system must respond quickly to user requests.
Scalability: The system must be able to handle increasing user loads.
Maintainability: The code must be modular and well-documented for easy maintenance.
Reliability: The system must be reliable and available.
3. System Design

3.1 Architecture:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore).
Database: Firebase Firestore.
3.2 Data Flow:
User registers/logs in.
User books a cylinder.
Booking data is stored in Firestore.
Administrator approves/rejects the booking.
User receives email and/or in-app notifications.
User pays for the cylinder.
3.3 Database Design:
Users Collection:
uid (Document ID)
email
password (hashed, handled by Firebase Authentication)
name
address
phone
bookings (count of bookings)
booking_history (array of booking objects)
is_admin (boolean)
Bookings Collection (or within user document):
booking_id
user_id
date
status (pending, approved, rejected)
payment_method
3.4 User Interface Design:
Simple and intuitive design with clear navigation.
Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.
Form-based interface for registration, login, and booking.
Display of booking history and notifications in lists.
4. Implementation

5. Testing

5.1 Unit Testing:
Testing individual functions and modules in the backend.
Using pytest (Python) or Jest (JavaScript).
5.2 Integration Testing:
Testing the interaction between different modules and services.
Testing the interaction between the frontend and backend.
5.3 Functional Testing:
Testing the system against the functional requirements.
Testing user registration, login, booking, and payment workflows.
5.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
Testing the system with real users to ensure it meets their needs.
5.5 Test Cases:
User Registration:
Valid email and password.
Invalid email format.
Weak password.
Existing email.
User Login:
Correct credentials.
Incorrect credentials.
Non-existent user.
Booking Cylinder:
Successful booking.
Insufficient user balance (if applicable).
Admin Approval:
Successful approval.
Successful rejection.
Payment Processing:
Successful payment.
Failed payment.
5.6 Logging:
Logging all major actions and errors on both the frontend and backend.
Using console.log, console.error (JavaScript) and the python logging module.
6. Deployment

6.1 Deployment Environment:
